This problem was asked by Twitch.

You are given an m by n matrix with with 0s and 1s, where a 1 represents an obstacle and a 0 represents no obstacle. Determine the number of ways to navigate from the top-left corner of the matrix to the bottom right corner given that at any point in time there is only a move down or to the right as long as there is not an obstacle in that spot.

For example, if the matrix is given by: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]] then you should return 1 since there is exactly one path.
