This problem was asked by Lyft.

Say that you are pushing a new feature X out. You have 1000 users and each user is either a fan or not a fan of X, at random. There are 50 users of 1000 that do not like X. You will decide whether to ship the feature or not based on sampling 5 users independently and if they all like the feature, you will ship it. What is the probability that you will ship the feature?
