This problem was asked by Twitter.

Say that there are n topics on Twitter and there is a notion of topics being related. Specifically, if topic A is related to topic B, and topic B is related to topic C, then topic A is indirectly related to topic C.

Define a topic group to be any group of topics that either directly or indirectly related. Given an n by n adjacency matrix N, where N[i][j] = 1 if topic i and topic are j related and 0 otherwise, write a function to determine how many topic groups are there.
