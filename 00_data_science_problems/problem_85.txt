This problem was asked by Disney.

Disney+ offers a 7-day free trial period. After 7 days, customers are charged whatever package they chose. Assume that there are customers who commit to Disney+ right away and therefore don't end up having a 7-day free trial period.

Disney wants to measure the success of the free trial. What metrics and analysis might you do to determine whether or not the free trial successfully acquires new customers?
