"""Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance 
(measured in number of words) between any two given words in a string.
For example, given words "hello", and "world" and a text 
content of "dog cat hello cat dog dog hello cat world", return 1 because 
there's only one word "cat" in between the two words.
