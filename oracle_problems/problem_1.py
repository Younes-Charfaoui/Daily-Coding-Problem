"""This problem was asked by Oracle.

We say a number is sparse if there are no adjacent ones in its binary representation. 
For example, 21 (10101) is sparse, but 22 (10110) is not. 
For a given input N, find the smallest sparse number greater than or equal to N.

Do this in faster than O(N log N) time.
