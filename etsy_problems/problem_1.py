"""This problem was asked by Etsy.

Given an array of numbers N and an integer k, your task is to split N into k 
partitions such that the maximum sum of any partition is minimized. Return this sum.

For example, given N = [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 4] and k = 3, you should return 8, since the optimal 
partition is [5, 1, 2], [7], [3, 4].
