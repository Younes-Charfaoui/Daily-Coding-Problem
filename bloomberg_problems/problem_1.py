"""
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Bloomberg.

Determine whether there exists a one-to-one character mapping from one string s1 to another s2.

For example, given s1 = abc and s2 = bcd, return true since we can map a to b, b to c, and c to d.

Given s1 = foo and s2 = bar, return false since the o cannot map to two characters.
