"""This problem was asked by Microsoft.
Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that returns
whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.
For example, given the following matrix:
[['F', 'A', 'C', 'I'],
 ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
 ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
 ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']]
and the target word 'FOAM', you should return true, since it's the leftmost column. 
Similarly, given the target word 'MASS', 
you should return true, since it's the last row.
