"""This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given an array of numbers arr and a window of size k, print out the median of 
each window of size k starting from the left and moving right by one position each time.

For example, given the following array and k = 3:

[-1, 5, 13, 8, 2, 3, 3, 1]
Your function should print out the following:

5 <- median of [-1, 5, 13]
8 <- median of [5, 13, 8]
8 <- median of [13, 8, 2]
3 <- median of [8, 2, 3]
3 <- median of [2, 3, 3]
3 <- median of [3, 3, 1]
Recall that the median of an even-sized list is the average of the two middle numbers.
