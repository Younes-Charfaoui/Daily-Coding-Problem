"""This problem was asked by Microsoft.

The transitive closure of a graph is a measure of which vertices are reachable from other vertices. 
It can be represented as a matrix M, where M[i][j] == 1 if there is a path between vertices i and j, and otherwise 0.

For example, suppose we are given the following graph in adjacency list form:

graph = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [3]
]
The transitive closure of this graph would be:

[1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
Given a graph, find its transitive closure.
