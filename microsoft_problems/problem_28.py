"""This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given a string, generate all possible subsequences of the string.

For example, given the string xyz, return an array or set with the following strings:


x
y
z
xy
xz
yz
xyz

Note that zx is not a valid subsequence since it is not in the order of the given string.
