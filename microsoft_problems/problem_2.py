"""This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers.
That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the
list so far on each new element.
Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of
the two middle numbers.

For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm
should print out:
2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
