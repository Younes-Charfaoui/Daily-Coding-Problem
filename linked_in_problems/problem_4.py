"""
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

Given a linked list of numbers and a pivot k, partition the linked list so that 
all nodes less than k come before nodes greater than or equal to k.

For example, given the linked list 5 -> 1 -> 8 -> 0 -> 3 and k = 3, the 
solution could be 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3.
