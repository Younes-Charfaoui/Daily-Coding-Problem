"""This problem was asked by Goldman Sachs.
Given a list of numbers L, implement a method sum(i, j) 
which returns the sum from the sublist L[i:j] (including i, excluding j).
For example, given L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], sum(1, 3) should return sum([2, 3]), which is 5.
You can assume that you can do some pre-processing. 
sum() should be optimized over the pre-processing step.
