"""This problem was asked by Nest.

Create a basic sentence checker that takes in a stream of characters and determines 
whether they form valid sentences. If a sentence is valid, the program should print it out.

We can consider a sentence valid if it conforms to the following rules:

	1- The sentence must start with a capital letter, 
	followed by a lowercase letter or a space.
	2- All other characters must be lowercase letters, separators (,,;,:) 
	or terminal marks (.,?,!,â€½).
	3- There must be a single space between each word.
	4- The sentence must end with a terminal mark immediately following a word.
