"""This problem was asked by Netflix.

A Cartesian tree with sequence S is a binary tree defined by the following two properties:

It is heap-ordered, so that each parent value is strictly less than that of its children.
An in-order traversal of the tree produces nodes with values that correspond exactly to S.
For example, given the sequence [3, 2, 6, 1, 9], the resulting Cartesian tree would be:

      1
    /   \   
  2       9
 / \
3   6
Given a sequence S, construct the corresponding Cartesian tree.
