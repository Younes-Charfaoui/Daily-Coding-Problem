"""This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you 
need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Intervals can "touch", such as [0, 1] and [1, 2], but they won't be considered overlapping.

For example, given the intervals (7, 9), (2, 4), (5, 8), return 1 as the 
last interval can be removed and the first two won't overlap.

The intervals are not necessarily sorted in any order.
