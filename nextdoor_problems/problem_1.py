"""This problem was asked by Nextdoor.

Implement integer division without using the division operator. 
Your function should return a tuple of (dividend, remainder) and 
it should take two numbers, the product and divisor.

For example, calling divide(10, 3) should return (3, 1) since the 
divisor is 3 and the remainder is 1.

Bonus: Can you do it in O(log n) time?
