"""This problem was asked by Amazon.
Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix.
A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s 
that are neighboring and their perimiter is surrounded by water.
For example, this matrix has 4 islands.
1 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
