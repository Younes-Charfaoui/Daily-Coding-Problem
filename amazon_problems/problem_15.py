"""This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, carrace should return true, 
since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. 
daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.
