"""This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a sorted array arr of distinct integers, 
return the lowest index i for which arr[i] == i. 

Return null if there is no such index.

For example, given the array [-5, -3, 2, 3], 
return 2 since arr[2] == 2. Even though arr[3] == 3, 
we return 2 since it's the lowest index.
