"""This problem was asked by Palantir.

Given a number represented by a list of digits, find the next greater permutation of a number, 
in terms of lexicographic ordering. If there is not greater permutation possible, 
return the permutation with the lowest value/ordering.

For example, the list [1,2,3] should return [1,3,2]. The list [1,3,2] should return [2,1,3].
 The list [3,2,1] should return [1,2,3].

Can you perform the operation without allocating extra memory (disregarding the input memory)?
