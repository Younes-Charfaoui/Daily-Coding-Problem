"""This problem was asked by Palantir.

The ancient Egyptians used to express fractions as a sum of several terms where each numerator is one. 
For example, 4 / 13 can be represented as 1 / 4 + 1 / 18 + 1 / 468.

Create an algorithm to turn an ordinary fraction a / b, where a < b, into an Egyptian fraction.
