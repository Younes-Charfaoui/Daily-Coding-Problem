"""This problem was asked by Snapchat.
Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of 
intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.
The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.
For example, given [(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)], 
you should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)]
