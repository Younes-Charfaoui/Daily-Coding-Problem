"""This problem was asked by Twitter.

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s
and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set
that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string de and the set of
strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal]."""
