"""This problem was asked by Mailchimp.

You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a city street, 
from east to west. The city assessor would like you to write an algorithm that returns how 
many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value the street.

For example, given the array [3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1], you should return 3, since the top floors 
of the buildings with heights 8, 6, and 1 all have an unobstructed view to the west.

Can you do this using just one forward pass through the array?
