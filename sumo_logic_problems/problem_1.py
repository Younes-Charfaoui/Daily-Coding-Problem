"""This problem was asked by Sumo Logic.

Given an unsorted array, in which all elements are distinct, find a "peak" element in O(log N) time.

An element is considered a peak if it is greater than both its left and right neighbors. 
It is guaranteed that the first and last elements are lower than all others.
