"""This problem was asked by Glassdoor.

An imminent hurricane threatens the coastal town of Codeville. 
If at most two people can fit in a rescue boat, 
and the maximum weight limit for a given boat is k, 
determine how many boats will be needed to save everyone.

For example, given a population with weights [100, 200, 150, 80] and a 
boat limit of 200, the smallest number of boats required will be three.
