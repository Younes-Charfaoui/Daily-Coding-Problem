"""This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a multiset of integers, return whether it can be partitioned into 
two subsets whose sums are the same.

For example, given the multiset {15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 15, 10}, it would return true, 
since we can split it up into {15, 5, 10, 15, 10} and {20, 35}, which both add up to 55.

Given the multiset {15, 5, 20, 10, 35}, it would return false, since we can't 
split it up into two subsets that add up to the same sum."""
