"""Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Facebook.
Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made 
by multiplying any three integers.
For example, if the list is [-10, -10, 5, 2], we should return 500, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.
You can assume the list has at least three integers.
