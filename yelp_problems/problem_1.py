"""This problem was asked by Yelp.

Given a mapping of digits to letters (as in a phone number), and a digit string, 
return all possible letters the number could represent. You can assume each 
valid number in the mapping is a single digit.
For example if {“2”: [“a”, “b”, “c”], 3: [“d”, “e”, “f”], …} 
then “23” should return [“ad”, “ae”, “af”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “cd”, “ce”, “cf"].
