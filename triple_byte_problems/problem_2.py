"""This problem was asked by Triplebyte.

Implement a data structure which carries out the following operations 
without resizing the underlying array:

add(value): Add a value to the set of values.
check(value): Check whether a value is in the set.

The check method may return occasional false positives (in other words, incorrectly 
identifying an element as part of the set), but should always correctly identify a true element.
