"""This problem was asked by Google.

The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. 
Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

For example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, it should return
 {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.

You may also use a list or array to represent a set."""
