"""This problem was asked by Google.

You are given a series of arithmetic equations as a string, such as:

y = x + 1
5 = x + 3
10 = z + y + 2
The equations use addition only and are separated by newlines. 
Return a mapping of all variables to their values. 
If it's not possible, then return null. In this example, you should return:

{
  x: 2,
  y: 3,
  z: 5
}
