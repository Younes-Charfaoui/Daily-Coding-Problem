"""This problem was asked by Google.
Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function
that returns a subset of S that adds up to k. If such a subset cannot
be made, then return null.
Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume
all numbers in the list are positive.
For example, given S = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2] and k = 24, return [12, 9, 2, 1] since it
sums up to 24.
