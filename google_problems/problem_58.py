"""This problem was asked by Google.
Given two rectangles on a 2D graph, return the area of their intersection. 
If the rectangles don't intersect, return 0.
For example, given the following rectangles:
{
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
}
and
{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions" (4, 3) # width, height
}
return 6.
